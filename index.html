		<h1>The Running Project</h1>

	<p>
	Hello everyone! My name is Chloe Welch this is all about my running project and how you can get started in running your first 5K! Before I go any further I would like everyone to know that I was never 
	a runner before. I have played travel soccer my whole life so I would always run, but running outside of my sport was never something I would do unless someone forced me.
	That being said, a couple of weeks ago I decided to tackle this challenge head on and start running more often. I initially started this for the physical benefits but the psychological benefits quickly consumed me.
	The sense of achievement I felt from making myself run was more than any sense of achievement I could have gotten from going to the gym and doing a workout. 
	</p>
	<p>
	With this new boost in enthusiasm, running for fun turned into my wanting to run for something. And that is when I decided to start training for a 5K. This new challenge is very daunting but I know if I work hard enough I can get there.
	I would also like to help others to get there as well. I think a lot of people would enjoy running if they had someone to do it with. Below I have listed my times after running for three weeks. I have also listed some things that
	you will need and the products that I personally use. 
	</p>
	<H2><b>Here are my personal running times over the last three weeks:</b></H2>

		</ul>
	<p>
	Headphones are not a necessity but I find it much easier to run with some good music to keep yourself from getting bored. 
	You can find many great running play lists on Spotify or you can make your own! A safe place to run is necessary to running. 
	You want to feel safe wherever you are running whether it is inside or outside.
	</p>
	<p>
	I get a lot of questions asking me where you should run, on a treadmill or outside. The answer to this question is subjective, but 
	in my personal opinion it is more of a workout on your legs and your body if you run outside. This is because of the change in elevation 
	and the temperature affects it as well. If it is hot outside, when you run you will be sweating less and thus burning more calories than you 
	would be inside. This can be beneficial to those of us that are trying to lose weight or get ready for summer!
